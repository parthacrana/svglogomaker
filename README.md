One thing I was still unable to was generate the read me file. I have the format for the readme.md file but it is not generating.

One thing I am not able to figure out...is how to show the text on the image. Image is being generated though. 






This is the screen recording of my assignment. The only problem is that the readme does not get generated. I am turning it in now. I will solve it and resubmit it ASAP.
